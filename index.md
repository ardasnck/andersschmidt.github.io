### Who am I

My name is Lei Mao. I am a master student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. My research interests are mainly in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and partly in the area of data science. 

<br />

Before I went to the University of Chicago, I was a PhD candidate in the Department of Biochemistry at Duke University. I also graduated with a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from Dalian University of Technology in China.

<br />

I am a perfectionist. I want to solve the problems in my hands in perfect ways, which is, however, not achievable in many situations.
